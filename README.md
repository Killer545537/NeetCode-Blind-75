# NeetCode Blind 75 Sheet

These are the solutions to **NeetCode Blind 75 Sheet** in `C++`. I am just going to complete them in this summer break and try to complete the 150 sheet as well?\
To run, install CMake and add the dependencies `Catch2`.\
I have added all the code and test cases (the ones visible on LeetCode) pretty neatly if I do say so myself.
